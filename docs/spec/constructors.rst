Constructors
============

Calls to constructors require special handling within type checkers.

Constructor Calls
-----------------

At runtime, a call to a class' constructor typically results in the invocation of
three methods in the following order:

#. The ``__call__`` method of the metaclass (which is typically supplied by the
   ``type`` class but can be overridden by a custom metaclass and which is
   responsible for calling the next two methods)
#. The ``__new__`` static method of the class
#. The ``__init__`` instance method of the class

Type checkers should mirror this runtime behavior when analyzing a constructor
call.

Metaclass ``__call__`` Method
-----------------------------

When evaluating a constructor call, a type checker should first check if the
class has a custom metaclass (a subclass of ``type``) that defines a ``__call__``
method. If so, it should evaluate the call of this method using the supplied
arguments. If the metaclass is ``type``, this step can be skipped.

If the evaluated return type of the ``__call__`` method indicates something
other than an instance of the class being constructed, a type checker should
assume that the metaclass ``__call__`` method is overriding ``type.__call__``
in some special manner, and it should not attempt to evaluate the ``__new__``
or ``__init__`` methods on the class. For example, some metaclass ``__call__``
methods are annotated to return ``NoReturn`` to indicate that constructor
calls are not supported for that class.

  ::

    class Meta(type):
        def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> NoReturn:
            raise TypeError("Cannot instantiate class")

    class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> Self:
            return super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)

    assert_type(MyClass(), Never)

If no return type annotation is provided for ``__call__``, a type checker may
assume that it does not override ``type.__call__`` in a special manner and
proceed as though the return type is an instance of the type specified by
the ``cls`` parameter.


``__new__`` Method
------------------

After the metaclass ``__call__`` method has been evaluated, a type checker
should evaluate the ``__new__`` method of the class (if applicable) using
the supplied arguments. This step should be skipped if the class does not
define a ``__new__`` method and does not inherit a ``__new__`` method from
a base class other than ``object``.

If the class is generic and explicitly specialized, the type checker should
partially specialize the ``__new__`` method using the supplied type arguments.
If the class is not explicitly specialized, class-scoped type variables should
be solved using the supplied arguments passed to the constructor call.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __new__(cls, x: T) -> Self:
            return super().__new__(cls)

    # Constructor calls for specialized classes
    assert_type(MyClass[int](1), MyClass[int])
    assert_type(MyClass[float](1), MyClass[float])
    MyClass[int](1.0)  # Type error

    # Constructor calls for non-specialized classes
    assert_type(MyClass(1), MyClass[int])
    assert_type(MyClass(1.0), MyClass[float])

If any class-scoped type variables are not solved when evaluating the ``__new__``
method call using the supplied arguments, these type variables should be left
unsolved, allowing the ``__init__`` method (if applicable) to be used to solve
them.

  ::

      class MyClass[T]:
          def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> Self:
              return super().__new__(cls)

          def __init__(self, x: T) -> None:
              pass

      assert_type(MyClass(1), MyClass[int])
      assert_type(MyClass(""), MyClass[str])

For most classes, the return type for the ``__new__`` method is typically
``Self``, but other types are also allowed. For example, the ``__new__``
method may return an instance of a subclass or an instance of some completely
unrelated class.

If the evaluated return type of ``__new__`` is not the class being constructed
(or a subclass thereof), a type checker should assume that the ``__init__``
method will not be called. This is consistent with the runtime behavior of the
``type.__call__`` method. If the ``__new__`` method return type is a union with
one or more members that are not the class being constructed (or a subclass
thereof), a type checker should likewise assume that the ``__init__`` method
will not be called.

  ::

    class MyClass:
        def __new__(cls) -> int:
            return 0

        # In this case, the __init__ method should not be considered
        # by the type checker when evaluating a constructor call.
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            pass

    assert_type(MyClass(), int)

For purposes of this test, an explicit return type of ``Any`` (or a
union containing ``Any``) should be treated as a type that is not an instance
of the class being constructed.

  ::

    class MyClass:
        def __new__(cls) -> Any:
            return 0

        # The __init__ method will not be called in this case, so
        # it should not be evaluated.
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            pass

    assert_type(MyClass(), Any)

If the return type of ``__new__`` is not annotated, a type checker may assume
that the return type is ``Self`` and proceed with the assumption that the
``__init__`` method will be called.

If the class is generic, it is possible for a ``__new__`` method to override
the specialized class type and return a class instance that is specialized
with different type arguments.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> "MyClass[list[T]]":
            ...

    assert_type(MyClass[int](), MyClass[list[int]])

If the ``cls`` parameter within the ``__new__`` method is not annotated, type
checkers should infer a type of ``type[Self]``. Regardless of whether the
type of the ``cls`` parameter is explicit or inferred, the type checker should
bind the class being constructed to the ``cls`` parameter and report any type
errors that arise during binding.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __new__(cls: "type[MyClass[int]]") -> "MyClass[int]": ...

    MyClass()  # OK
    MyClass[int]()  # OK
    MyClass[str]()  # Type Error


``__init__`` Method
-------------------

After evaluating the ``__new__`` method, a type checker should evaluate the
``__init__`` method (if applicable) using the supplied arguments. If the class
is generic and explicitly specialized (or specialized via the ``__new__`` method
return type), the type checker should partially specialize the ``__init__``
method using the supplied type arguments. If the class is not explicitly
specialized, class-scoped type variables should be solved using the supplied
arguments passed to the constructor call.

This step should be skipped if the class does not define an ``__init__`` method
and does not inherit an ``__init__`` method from a base class other than
``object``.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __init__(self, x: T) -> None:
            ...

    # Constructor calls for specialized classes
    assert_type(MyClass[int](1), MyClass[int])
    assert_type(MyClass[float](1), MyClass[float])
    MyClass[int](1.0)  # Type error

    # Constructor calls for non-specialized classes
    assert_type(MyClass(1), MyClass[int])
    assert_type(MyClass(1.0), MyClass[float])

If the ``self`` parameter within the ``__init__`` method is not annotated, type
checkers should infer a type of ``Self``. Regardless of whether the ``self``
parameter type is explicit or inferred, a type checker should bind the class
being constructed to this parameter and report any type errors that arise
during binding.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __init__(self: "MyClass[int]") -> None: ...

    MyClass()  # OK
    MyClass[int]()  # OK
    MyClass[str]()  # Type Error

The return type for ``__init__`` is always ``None``, which means the
method cannot influence the return type of the constructor call by specifying
a return type. There are cases where it is desirable for the ``__init__`` method
to influence the return type, especially when the ``__init__`` method is
overloaded. To enable this, type checkers should allow the ``self`` parameter
to be annotated with a type that influences the resulting type of the
constructor call.

  ::

    class MyClass1[T]:
        @overload
        def __init__(self: "MyClass1[list[int]]", value: int) -> None: ...
        @overload
        def __init__(self: "MyClass1[set[str]]", value: str) -> None: ...
        @overload
        def __init__(self, value: T) -> None: ...


    assert_type(MyClass1(0), MyClass1[list[int]])
    assert_type(MyClass1[int](3), MyClass1[int])
    assert_type(MyClass1(""), MyClass1[set[str]])
    assert_type(MyClass1(3.0), MyClass1[float])


Function-scoped type variables can also be used in the ``self``
annotation of an ``__init__`` method to influence the return type of the
constructor call.

  ::

    class MyClass2[T1, T2]:
        def __init__[V1, V2](self: "MyClass2[V1, V2]", value1: V1, value2: V2) -> None: ...

    assert_type(MyClass2(0, ""), MyClass2[int, str])
    assert_type(MyClass2[int, str](0, ""), MyClass2[int, str])

    class MyClass3[T1, T2]:
        def __init__[V1, V2](self: "MyClass3[V2, V1]", value1: V1, value2: V2) -> None: ...

    assert_type(MyClass3(0, ""), MyClass3[str, int])
    assert_type(MyClass3[str, int](0, ""), MyClass3[str, int])


Class-scoped type variables should not be used in the ``self`` annotation
because such use can lead to ambiguous or nonsensical type evaluation results.
Type checkers should report an error if a class-scoped type variable is used
within a type annotation for the ``self`` parameter in an ``__init__`` method.

  ::

    class MyClass4[T1, T2]:
        # The ``self`` annotation should result in a type error
        def __init__(self: "MyClass4[T2, T1]") -> None: ...


Classes Without ``__new__`` and ``__init__`` Methods
----------------------------------------------------

If a class does not define a ``__new__`` method or ``__init__`` method and
does not inherit either of these methods from a base class other than
``object``, a type checker should evaluate the argument list using the
``__new__`` and ``__init__`` methods from the ``object`` class.

  ::

    class MyClass5:
        pass

    MyClass5()  # OK
    MyClass5(1)  # Type error


Constructor Calls for type[T]
-----------------------------

When a value of type ``type[T]`` (where ``T`` is a concrete class or a type
variable) is called, a type checker should evaluate the constructor call as if
it is being made on the class ``T`` (or the class that represents the upper bound
of type variable ``T``). This means the type checker should use the ``__call__``
method of ``T``'s metaclass and the ``__new__`` and ``__init__`` methods of ``T``
to evaluate the constructor call.

It should be noted that such code could be unsafe because the type ``type[T]``
may represent subclasses of ``T``, and those subclasses could redefine the
``__new__`` and ``__init__`` methods in a way that is incompatible with the
base class. Likewise, the metaclass of ``T`` could redefine the ``__call__``
method in a way that is incompatible with the base metaclass.


Specialization During Construction
----------------------------------

As discussed above, if a class is generic and not explicitly specialized, its
type variables should be solved using the arguments passed to the ``__new__``
and ``__init__`` methods. If one or more type variables are not solved during
these method evaluations, they should take on their default values.

  ::

    T1 = TypeVar("T1")
    T2 = TypeVar("T2")
    T3 = TypeVar("T3", default=str)

    class MyClass1(Generic[T1, T2]):
        def __new__(cls, x: T1) -> Self: ...

    assert_type(MyClass1(1), MyClass1[int, Any])

    class MyClass2(Generic[T1, T3]):
        def __new__(cls, x: T1) -> Self: ...

    assert_type(MyClass2(1), MyClass2[int, str])


Consistency of ``__new__`` and ``__init__``
-------------------------------------------

Type checkers may optionally validate that the ``__new__`` and ``__init__``
methods for a class have :term:`consistent` signatures.

  ::

    class MyClass:
        def __new__(cls) -> Self:
            return super().__new__(cls)

        # Type error: __new__ and __init__ have inconsistent signatures
        def __init__(self, x: str) -> None:
            pass


Converting a Constructor to Callable
------------------------------------

Class objects are callable, which means the type of a class object can be
:term:`assignable` to a callable type.

  ::

    def accepts_callable[**P, R](cb: Callable[P, R]) -> Callable[P, R]:
        return cb

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, x: int) -> None:
            pass

    reveal_type(accepts_callable(MyClass))  # ``def (x: int) -> MyClass``

When converting a class to a callable type, a type checker should use the
following rules, which reflect the same rules specified above for evaluating
constructor calls:

1. If the class has a custom metaclass that defines a ``__call__`` method
   that is annotated with a return type other than a subclass of the
   class being constructed (or a union that contains such a type), a type
   checker should assume that the metaclass ``__call__`` method is overriding
   ``type.__call__`` in some special manner. In this case, the callable should
   be synthesized from the parameters and return type of the metaclass
   ``__call__`` method after it is bound to the class, and the ``__new__`` or
   ``__init__`` methods (if present) should be ignored. This is an uncommon
   case. In the more typical case where there is no custom metaclass that
   overrides ``type.__call__`` in a special manner, the metaclass ``__call__``
   signature should be ignored for purposes of converting to a callable type.
   If a custom metaclass ``__call__`` method is present but does not have an
   annotated return type, type checkers may assume that the method acts like
   ``type.__call__`` and proceed to the next step.

2. If the class defines a ``__new__`` method or inherits a ``__new__`` method
   from a base class other than ``object``, a type checker should synthesize a
   callable from the parameters and return type of that method after it is bound
   to the class.

3. If the return type of the method in step 2 evaluates to a type that is not a
   subclass of the class being constructed (or a union that includes such a
   class), the final callable type is based on the result of step 2, and the
   conversion process is complete. The ``__init__`` method is ignored in this
   case. This is consistent with the runtime behavior of the ``type.__call__``
   method.

4. If the class defines an ``__init__`` method or inherits an ``__init__`` method
   from a base class other than ``object``, a callable type should be synthesized
   from the parameters of the ``__init__`` method after it is bound to the class
   instance resulting from step 2. The return type of this synthesized callable
   should be the concrete value of ``Self``.

5. If step 2 and 4 both produce no result because the class does not define or
   inherit a ``__new__`` or ``__init__`` method from a class other than ``object``,
   the type checker should synthesize callable types from the ``__new__`` and
   ``__init__`` methods for the ``object`` class.

6. Steps 2, 4 and 5 will produce either one or two callable types. The final
   result of the conversion process is the union of these types. This will
   reflect the callable signatures of the applicable ``__new__`` and
   ``__init__`` methods.

  ::

    class A:
        """ No __new__ or __init__ """
        pass

    class B:
        """ __new__ and __init__ """
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> Self:
            ...

        def __init__(self, x: int) -> None:
            ...

    class C:
        """ __new__ but no __init__ """
        def __new__(cls, x: int) -> int:
            ...

    class CustomMeta(type):
        def __call__(cls) -> NoReturn:
            raise NotImplementedError("Class not constructable")

    class D(metaclass=CustomMeta):
        """ Custom metaclass that overrides type.__call__ """
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs) -> Self:
            """ This __new__ is ignored for purposes of conversion """
            pass


    class E:
        """ __new__ that causes __init__ to be ignored """

        def __new__(cls) -> A:
            return A.__new__(cls)

        def __init__(self, x: int) -> None:
            """ This __init__ is ignored for purposes of conversion """
            ...


    reveal_type(accepts_callable(A))  # ``def () -> A``
    reveal_type(accepts_callable(B))  # ``def (*args, **kwargs) -> B | def (x: int) -> B``
    reveal_type(accepts_callable(C))  # ``def (x: int) -> int``
    reveal_type(accepts_callable(D))  # ``def () -> NoReturn``
    reveal_type(accepts_callable(E))  # ``def () -> A``


If the ``__init__`` or ``__new__`` method is overloaded, the callable
type should be synthesized from the overloads. The resulting callable type
itself will be overloaded.

  ::

    class MyClass:
        @overload
        def __init__(self, x: int) -> None: ...
        @overload
        def __init__(self, x: str) -> None: ...

    reveal_type(accepts_callable(MyClass))  # overload of ``def (x: int) -> MyClass`` and ``def (x: str) -> MyClass``


If the class is generic, the synthesized callable should include any class-scoped
type parameters that appear within the signature, but these type parameters should
be converted to function-scoped type parameters for the callable.
Any function-scoped type parameters in the ``__init__`` or ``__new__``
method should also be included as function-scoped type parameters in the synthesized
callable.

  ::

    class MyClass[T]:
        def __init__[V](self, x: T, y: list[V], z: V) -> None: ...

    reveal_type(accepts_callable(MyClass))  # ``def [T, V] (x: T, y: list[V], z: V) -> MyClass[T]``
