.. glossary::

   annotation expression
      An expression that is valid to use within an annotation. This is usually a
      :term:`type expression`, sometimes with additional :term:`type qualifiers <type qualifier>`.
      See :ref:`"Type and annotation expression" <annotation-expression>` for details.

   assignable
      If a type ``B`` is "assignable to" a type ``A``, a  type checker should
      not error on the assignment ``x: A = b``, where ``b`` is some expression
      whose type is ``B``. Similarly for function calls and returns: ``f(b)``
      where ``def f(x: A): ...`` and ``return b`` inside ``def f(...) -> A:
      ...`` are both valid (not type errors) if and only if ``B`` is assignable
      to ``A``. In this case ``A`` is "assignable from" ``B``. For :term:`fully
      static types <fully static type>`, "assignable to" is equivalent to
      ":term:`subtype` of" and "assignable from" is equivalent to
      ":term:`supertype` of". For :term:`gradual types <gradual type>`, a type
      ``B`` is assignable to a type ``A`` if there exist fully static
      :term:`materializations <materialize>` ``A'`` and ``B'`` of ``A`` and
      ``B``, respectively, such that ``B'`` is a subtype of ``A'``. See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   consistent
      Two :term:`fully static types <fully static type>` are "consistent with"
      each other if they are :term:`equivalent`. Two gradual types are
      "consistent with" each other if they could :term:`materialize` to the
      same type. See :ref:`type-system-concepts`. If two types are consistent,
      they are both :term:`assignable` to and from each other.

   consistent subtype
      "Consistent subtype" is synonymous with ":term:`assignable` to" (and
      "consistent supertype" is synonymous with "assignable from"). See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   distribution
      The packaged file which is used to publish and distribute
      a release. (:pep:`426`)

   equivalent
      Two :term:`fully static types <fully static type>` ``A`` and ``B`` are
      equivalent if ``A`` is a :term:`subtype` of ``B`` and ``B`` is a
      :term:`subtype` of ``A``. This implies that ``A`` and ``B`` represent the
      same set of possible runtime objects. Two gradual types ``A`` and ``B``
      are equivalent if all :term:`materializations <materialize>` of ``A`` are
      also materializations of ``B``, and all materializations of ``B`` are
      also materializations of ``A``.

   fully static type
      A type is "fully static" if it does not contain any :term:`gradual form`.
      A fully static type represents a set of possible runtime values. Fully
      static types participate in the :term:`subtype` relation. See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   gradual form
      A gradual form is an element of a :term:`type expression` which makes the type it is
      part of not a :term:`fully static type`, but rather a representation of a
      set of possible static types. See :ref:`type-system-concepts`. The
      primary gradual form is :ref:`Any`. The ellipsis (``...``) is a gradual
      form in some, but not all, contexts. It is a gradual form when used in a
      :ref:`Callable` type, and when used in ``tuple[Any, ...]`` (but not in
      other :ref:`tuple <tuples>` types).

   gradual type
      All types in the Python type system are "gradual". A gradual type may be
      a :term:`fully static type`, or it may be :ref:`Any`, or a type that
      contains ``Any`` or another :term:`gradual form`. A gradual type does not
      necessarily represent a single set of possible runtime values; instead it
      can represent a set of possible static types (a set of possible sets of
      possible runtime values). Gradual types which are not fully static do not
      participate in the :term:`subtype` relation, but they do participate in
      :term:`consistency <consistent>` and :term:`assignability <assignable>`.
      They can be :term:`materialized <materialize>` to a more static, or fully static,
      type. See :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   inline
      Inline type annotations are annotations that are included in the
      runtime code using :pep:`526` and
      :pep:`3107` syntax (the filename ends in ``.py``).

   materialize
      A :term:`gradual type` can be materialized to a more static type
      (possibly a :term:`fully static type`) by replacing :ref:`Any` with any
      other type, or by replacing the `...` in a :ref:`Callable` type with a
      list of types, or by replacing ``tuple[Any, ...]`` with a specific-length
      tuple type. This materialization relation is key to defining
      :term:`assignability <assignable>` for gradual types. See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   module
      A file containing Python runtime code or stubbed type information.

   narrow
      A :term:`fully static type` ``B`` is narrower than a fully static type
      ``A`` if ``B`` is a :term:`subtype` of ``A`` and ``B`` is not
      :term:`equivalent` to ``A``. This means that ``B`` represents a proper
      subset of the possible objects represented by ``A``. "Type narrowing" is
      when a type checker infers that a name or expression must have a narrower
      type at some locations in control flow, due to an assignment or a runtime
      check of its value.

   nominal
      A nominal type (e.g. a class name) represents the set of values whose
      ``__class__`` is that type, or any of its subclasses, transitively. In
      contrast, see :term:`structural` types.

   package
      A directory or directories that namespace Python modules.
      (Note the distinction between packages and :term:`distributions <distribution>`.
      While most distributions are named after the one package they install, some
      distributions install multiple packages.)

   special form
      A special form is an object that has a special meaning within the type system,
      comparable to a keyword in the language grammar. Examples include ``Any``,
      ``Generic``,  ``Literal``, and ``TypedDict``. Special forms can often but not always be used
      within :ref:`type expressions <type-expression>`. Special forms can usually
      be imported from the :py:mod:`typing` module or equivalently from ``typing_extensions``,
      but some special forms are placed in other modules.

   structural
      A structural type (see e.g. :ref:`Protocols`, :ref:`TypedDict`) defines a
      set of values not by their ``__class__``, but by their properties (e.g.
      attributes, methods, dictionary key/value types). :ref:`Callable` types
      are also structural; a callable type is a subtype of another callable
      type based on their signatures, not a subclass relationship. In contrast,
      see :term:`nominal` types.

   stub
      A file containing only type information, empty of runtime code
      (the filename ends in ``.pyi``). See :ref:`stub-files`.

   subtype
      A :term:`fully static type` ``B`` is a subtype of a fully static type
      ``A`` if and only if the set of possible runtime values represented by
      ``B`` is a subset of the set of possible runtime values represented by
      ``A``. For :term:`nominal` types (classes), subtyping is defined by
      inheritance. For :term:`structural` types, subtyping is defined by a
      shared set of attributes/methods or keys. Subtype is the inverse of
      :term:`supertype`. A type that is not fully static is not a subtype or
      supertype of any other type, but via :term:`materialization
      <materialize>` can be :term:`assignable` to another type. See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   supertype
      A :term:`fully static type` ``A`` is a supertype of a fully static type
      ``B`` if and only if the set of possible runtime values represented by
      ``A`` is a superset of the set of possible runtime values represented by
      ``B``. Supertype is the inverse of :term:`subtype`. See
      :ref:`type-system-concepts`.

   type expression
      An expression that represents a type. The type system requires the use of type
      expressions within :term:`annotation expression` and also in several other contexts.
      See :ref:`"Type and annotation expression" <type-expression>` for details.

   type qualifier
      A type qualifier is a :term:`special form` that qualifies a :term:`type expression` to
      form an :term:`annotation expression`. For example, the type qualifier :ref:`Final <uppercase-final>`
      can be used around a type to indicate that the annotated value may not be overridden or modified.
      This term is also used for other special forms that modify a type, but using a different
      syntactic context, such as the :ref:`@final <at-final>` decorator.

   wide
      A :term:`fully static type` ``A`` is wider than a fully static type ``B``
      if and only if ``B`` is a :term:`subtype` of ``A`` and ``B`` is not
      :term:`equivalent` to ``A``. This means that ``A`` represents a proper
      superset of the possible values represented by ``B``. See also
      ":term:`narrow`".
