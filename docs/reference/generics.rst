Generics
========

You may have seen type hints like ``list[str]`` or ``dict[str, int]`` in Python
code. These types are interesting in that they are parametrised by other types!
A ``list[str]`` isn't just a list, it's a list of strings. Types with type
parameters like this are called *generic types*.

You can define your own generic classes that take type parameters, similar to
built-in types such as ``list[X]``. Note that such user-defined generics are a
moderately advanced feature and you can get far without ever using them.

.. _generic-classes:

Defining generic classes
************************

Here is a very simple generic class that represents a stack:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar, Generic

   T = TypeVar('T')

   class Stack(Generic[T]):
       def __init__(self) -> None:
           # Create an empty list with items of type T
           self.items: list[T] = []

       def push(self, item: T) -> None:
           self.items.append(item)

       def pop(self) -> T:
           return self.items.pop()

       def empty(self) -> bool:
           return not self.items

The ``Stack`` class can be used to represent a stack of any type:
``Stack[int]``, ``Stack[tuple[int, str]]``, etc.

Using ``Stack`` is similar to built-in container types, like ``list``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Construct an empty Stack[int] instance
   stack = Stack[int]()
   stack.push(2)
   stack.pop() + 1
   stack.push('x')  # error: Argument 1 to "push" of "Stack" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"

When creating instances of generic classes, the type argument can usually be
inferred. In cases where you explicitly specify the type argument, the
construction of the instance will be type checked correspondingly.

.. code-block:: python

   class Box(Generic[T]):
       def __init__(self, content: T) -> None:
           self.content = content

   Box(1)       # OK, inferred type is Box[int]
   Box[int](1)  # Also OK
   Box[int]('some string')  # error: Argument 1 to "Box" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"

.. _generic-subclasses:

Defining subclasses of generic classes
**************************************

User-defined generic classes and generic classes defined in :py:mod:`typing`
can be used as a base class for another class (generic or non-generic). For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Generic, TypeVar, Mapping, Iterator

    KT = TypeVar('KT')
    VT = TypeVar('VT')

    # This is a generic subclass of Mapping
    class MyMap(Mapping[KT, VT]):
        def __getitem__(self, k: KT) -> VT: ...
        def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[KT]: ...
        def __len__(self) -> int: ...

    items: MyMap[str, int]  # OK

    # This is a non-generic subclass of dict
    class StrDict(dict[str, str]):
        def __str__(self) -> str:
            return f'StrDict({super().__str__()})'


    data: StrDict[int, int]  # error: "StrDict" expects no type arguments, but 2 given
    data2: StrDict  # OK

   # This is a user-defined generic class
   class Receiver(Generic[T]):
       def accept(self, value: T) -> None: ...

   # This is a generic subclass of Receiver
   class AdvancedReceiver(Receiver[T]): ...

.. note::

    Note that you have to explicitly inherit from :py:class:`~typing.Mapping`
    and :py:class:`~typing.Sequence` for your class to be considered a mapping
    or sequence. This is because these classes are nominally typed, unlike
    protocols like :py:class:`~typing.Iterable`, which use
    :ref:`structural subtyping <protocol-types>`.

:py:class:`Generic <typing.Generic>` can be omitted from bases if there are
other base classes that include type variables, such as ``Mapping[KT, VT]``
in the above example. If you include ``Generic[...]`` in bases, then
it should list all type variables present in other bases (or more,
if needed). The order of type variables is defined by the following
rules:

* If ``Generic[...]`` is present, then the order of variables is
  always determined by their order in ``Generic[...]``.
* If there are no ``Generic[...]`` in bases, then all type variables
  are collected in the lexicographic order (i.e. by first appearance).

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Generic, TypeVar, Any

   T = TypeVar('T')
   S = TypeVar('S')
   U = TypeVar('U')

   class One(Generic[T]): ...
   class Another(Generic[T]): ...

   class First(One[T], Another[S]): ...
   class Second(One[T], Another[S], Generic[S, U, T]): ...

   x: First[int, str]        # Here T is bound to int, S is bound to str
   y: Second[int, str, Any]  # Here T is Any, S is int, and U is str

.. _generic-functions:

Generic functions
*****************

Type variables can be used to define generic functions. These are functions
where the types of the arguments or return value have some relationship:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar, Sequence

   T = TypeVar('T')

   # A generic function!
   def first(seq: Sequence[T]) -> T:
       return seq[0]

As with generic classes, the type variable can be replaced with any
type. That means ``first`` can be used with any sequence type, and the
return type is derived from the sequence item type. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   reveal_type(first([1, 2, 3]))   # Revealed type is "builtins.int"
   reveal_type(first(['a', 'b']))  # Revealed type is "builtins.str"

Since type variables are about describing the relationship between
two or more types, it's usually not useful to have a type variable
only appear once in a function signature.

Note that for convenience, a single type variable symbol (such as ``T`` above)
can be used in multiple generic functions or classes, even though the logical
scope is different in each generic function or class. In the following example
we reuse the same type variable symbol in two generic functions; these two
functions do not share any typing relationship to each other:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar, Sequence

   T = TypeVar('T')

   def first(seq: Sequence[T]) -> T:
       return seq[0]

   def last(seq: Sequence[T]) -> T:
       return seq[-1]

Variables should not have a type variable in their type unless the type variable
is bound by a containing generic class, generic function or generic alias.

.. _generic-methods-and-generic-self:

Generic methods and generic self
********************************

You can also define generic methods â€” just use a type variable in the
method signature that is different from the type variable(s) bound in
the class definition.

.. code-block:: python

    # T is the type variable bound by this class
    class PairedBox(Generic[T]):
        def __init__(self, content: T) -> None:
            self.content = content

        # S is a type variable bound only in this method
        def first(self, x: list[S]) -> S:
            return x[0]

        def pair_with_first(self, x: list[S]) -> tuple[S, T]:
            return (x[0], self.content)

    box = PairedBox("asdf")
    reveal_type(box.first([1, 2, 3]))  # Revealed type is "builtins.int"
    reveal_type(box.pair_with_first([1, 2, 3]))  # Revealed type is "tuple[builtins.int, builtins.str]"

In particular, the ``self`` argument may also be generic, allowing a
method to return the most precise type known at the point of access.
In this way, for example, you can type check a chain of setter
methods:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar

   T = TypeVar('T', bound='Shape')

   class Shape:
       def set_scale(self: T, scale: float) -> T:
           self.scale = scale
           return self

   class Circle(Shape):
       def set_radius(self, r: float) -> 'Circle':
           self.radius = r
           return self

   class Square(Shape):
       def set_width(self, w: float) -> 'Square':
           self.width = w
           return self

   circle: Circle = Circle().set_scale(0.5).set_radius(2.7)
   square: Square = Square().set_scale(0.5).set_width(3.2)

Without using generic ``self``, the last two lines could not be type
checked properly, since the return type of ``set_scale`` would be
``Shape``, which doesn't define ``set_radius`` or ``set_width``.

Other uses are factory methods, such as copy and deserialization.
For class methods, you can also define generic ``cls``, using :py:class:`type`:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Optional, TypeVar, Type

   T = TypeVar('T', bound='Friend')

   class Friend:
       other: Optional["Friend"] = None

       @classmethod
       def make_pair(cls: type[T]) -> tuple[T, T]:
           a, b = cls(), cls()
           a.other = b
           b.other = a
           return a, b

   class SuperFriend(Friend):
       pass

   a, b = SuperFriend.make_pair()

Note that when overriding a method with generic ``self``, you must either
return a generic ``self`` too, or return an instance of the current class.
In the latter case, you must implement this method in all future subclasses.

Note also that the type checker may not always verify that the implementation of a copy
or a deserialization method returns the actual type of self. Therefore
you may need to silence the type checker inside these methods (but not at the call site),
possibly by making use of the ``Any`` type or a ``# type: ignore`` comment.

Automatic self types using typing.Self
**************************************

Since the patterns described above are quite common, a simpler syntax
was introduced in :pep:`673`.

Instead of defining a type variable and using an explicit annotation
for ``self``, you can use the special type ``typing.Self``. This is
automatically transformed into a type variable with the current class
as the upper bound, and you don't need an annotation for ``self`` (or
``cls`` in class methods).

Here's what the example from the previous section looks like
when using ``typing.Self``:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Self

   class Friend:
       other: Self | None = None

       @classmethod
       def make_pair(cls) -> tuple[Self, Self]:
           a, b = cls(), cls()
           a.other = b
           b.other = a
           return a, b

   class SuperFriend(Friend):
       pass

   a, b = SuperFriend.make_pair()

This is more compact than using explicit type variables. Also, you can
use ``Self`` in attribute annotations in addition to methods.

.. note::

   To use this feature on Python versions earlier than 3.11, you will need to
   import ``Self`` from ``typing_extensions`` (version 4.0 or newer).

.. _variance-of-generics:

Variance of generic types
*************************

There are three main kinds of generic types with respect to subtype
relations between them: invariant, covariant, and contravariant.
Assuming that we have a pair of types ``Animal`` and ``Bear``, and
``Bear`` is a subtype of ``Animal``, these are defined as follows:

* A generic class ``MyCovGen[T]`` is called covariant in type parameter
  ``T`` if ``MyCovGen[Bear]`` is a subtype of ``MyCovGen[Animal]``.
  This is the most intuitive form of variance.
* A generic class ``MyContraGen[T]`` is called contravariant in type
  parameter ``T`` if ``MyContraGen[Animal]`` is a subtype of
  ``MyContraGen[Bear]``.
* A generic class ``MyInvGen[T]`` is called invariant in ``T`` if neither
  of the above is true.

Let us illustrate this by few simple examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # We'll use these classes in the examples below
    class Shape: ...
    class Triangle(Shape): ...
    class Square(Shape): ...

* Most immutable containers, such as :py:class:`~typing.Sequence` and
  :py:class:`~typing.FrozenSet` are covariant. :py:data:`~typing.Union` is
  also covariant in all variables: ``Union[Triangle, int]`` is
  a subtype of ``Union[Shape, int]``.

  .. code-block:: python

    def count_lines(shapes: Sequence[Shape]) -> int:
        return sum(shape.num_sides for shape in shapes)

    triangles: Sequence[Triangle]
    count_lines(triangles)  # OK

    def foo(triangle: Triangle, num: int):
        shape_or_number: Union[Shape, int]
        # a Triangle is a Shape, and a Shape is a valid Union[Shape, int]
        shape_or_number = triangle

  Covariance should feel relatively intuitive, but contravariance and invariance
  can be harder to reason about.

* :py:data:`~typing.Callable` is an example of type that behaves contravariantly
  in types of arguments. That is, ``Callable[[Shape], int]`` is a subtype of
  ``Callable[[Triangle], int]``, despite ``Shape`` being a supertype of
  ``Triangle``. To understand this, consider:

  .. code-block:: python

    def cost_of_paint_required(
        triangle: Triangle,
        area_calculator: Callable[[Triangle], float]
    ) -> float:
        return area_calculator(triangle) * DOLLAR_PER_SQ_FT

    # This straightforwardly works
    def area_of_triangle(triangle: Triangle) -> float: ...
    cost_of_paint_required(triangle, area_of_triangle)  # OK

    # But this works as well!
    def area_of_any_shape(shape: Shape) -> float: ...
    cost_of_paint_required(triangle, area_of_any_shape)  # OK

  ``cost_of_paint_required`` needs a callable that can calculate the area of a
  triangle. If we give it a callable that can calculate the area of an
  arbitrary shape (not just triangles), everything still works.

* :py:class:`~typing.List` is an invariant generic type. Naively, one would think
  that it is covariant, like :py:class:`~typing.Sequence` above, but consider this code:

  .. code-block:: python

     class Circle(Shape):
         # The rotate method is only defined on Circle, not on Shape
         def rotate(self): ...

     def add_one(things: list[Shape]) -> None:
         things.append(Shape())

     my_circles: list[Circle] = []
     add_one(my_circles)     # This may appear safe, but...
     my_circles[-1].rotate()  # ...this will fail, since my_circles[0] is now a Shape, not a Circle

  Another example of an invariant type is :py:class:`~typing.Dict`. Most mutable containers
  are invariant.

By default, all user-defined generics are invariant.
To declare a given generic class as covariant or contravariant use
type variables defined with special keyword arguments ``covariant`` or
``contravariant``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Generic, TypeVar

   T_co = TypeVar('T_co', covariant=True)

   class Box(Generic[T_co]):  # this type is declared covariant
       def __init__(self, content: T_co) -> None:
           self._content = content

       def get_content(self) -> T_co:
           return self._content

   def look_into(box: Box[Animal]): ...

   my_box = Box(Cat())
   look_into(my_box)  # OK, but would be an error if Box was invariant in T

.. _type-variable-upper-bound:

Type variables with upper bounds
********************************

By default, a type variable can be replaced with any type. This means that
you can't do very much with an object of type ``T`` safely -- you don't
know anything about it!

It's therefore often useful to be able to limit the types that a type
variable can take on, for instance, by restricting it to values that are
subtypes of a specific type.

Such a type is called the upper bound of the type variable, and is specified
with the ``bound=...`` keyword argument to :py:class:`~typing.TypeVar`.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import TypeVar, SupportsAbs

    T = TypeVar('T', bound=SupportsAbs[float])

In the definition of a generic function that uses such a type variable
``T``, the type represented by ``T`` is assumed to be a subtype of
its upper bound, so the function can use methods of the upper bound on
values of type ``T``.

.. code-block:: python

    def largest_in_absolute_value(*xs: T) -> T:
        return max(xs, key=abs)  # Okay, because T is a subtype of SupportsAbs[float].

In a call to such a function, the type ``T`` must be replaced by a
type that is a subtype of its upper bound. Continuing the example
above:

.. code-block:: python

    largest_in_absolute_value(-3.5, 2)   # OK, has type float
    largest_in_absolute_value(5+6j, 7)   # OK, has type complex
    largest_in_absolute_value('a', 'b')  # error: error: Value of type variable "T" of "largest_in_absolute_value" cannot be "str"

Type parameters of generic classes may also have upper bounds, which
restrict the valid values for the type parameter in the same way.

.. _type-variable-value-restriction:

Type variables with constraints
*******************************

In some cases, it can be useful to restrict the values that a type variable can take to
exactly a specific set of types. This feature is a little complex and should
be avoided if an upper bound can be made to work instead, as above.

An example is a type variable that can only have values ``str`` and ``bytes``:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar

   AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)

This is actually such a common type variable that :py:data:`~typing.AnyStr` is
defined in :py:mod:`typing`.

We can use :py:data:`~typing.AnyStr` to define a function that can concatenate
two strings or bytes objects, but it can't be called with other
argument types:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import AnyStr

   def concat(x: AnyStr, y: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
       return x + y

   concat('a', 'b')    # Okay
   concat(b'a', b'b')  # Okay
   concat(1, 2)        # Error!

Importantly, this is different from a union type, since combinations
of ``str`` and ``bytes`` are not accepted:

.. code-block:: python

   concat('string', b'bytes')   # Error!

In this case, this is exactly what we want, since it's not possible
to concatenate a string and a bytes object! If we tried to use
``Union``, the type checker would complain about this possibility:

.. code-block:: python

   def union_concat(x: Union[str, bytes], y: Union[str, bytes]) -> Union[str, bytes]:
       return x + y  # Error: can't concatenate str and bytes

Another interesting special case is calling ``concat()`` with a
subtype of ``str``:

.. code-block:: python

    class S(str): pass

    ss = concat(S('foo'), S('bar'))
    reveal_type(ss)  # Revealed type is "builtins.str"

You may expect that the type of ``ss`` is ``S``, but the type is
actually ``str``: a subtype gets promoted to one of the valid values
for the type variable, which in this case is ``str``.

This is thus subtly different from *bounded quantification* in languages such as
Java, where the return type would be ``S``. The way type checkers implement this
actually does exactly what we want for ``concat``, since ``concat`` returns an
instance of exactly ``str`` in the above example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(type(ss))
    <class 'str'>

You can also use a :py:class:`~typing.TypeVar` with a restricted set of possible
values when defining a generic class. For example, you can use the type
:py:class:`Pattern[AnyStr] <typing.Pattern>` for the return value of :py:func:`re.compile`,
since regular expressions can be based on a string or a bytes pattern.

A type variable may not have both a value restriction (see
:ref:`type-variable-upper-bound`) and an upper bound.

.. _declaring-decorators:

Declaring decorators
********************

Decorators are typically functions that take a function as an argument and
return another function. Describing this behaviour in terms of types can
be a little tricky; we'll show how you can use ``TypeVar`` and a special
kind of type variable called a *parameter specification* to do so.

Suppose we have the following decorator, not type annotated yet,
that preserves the original function's signature and merely prints the decorated function's name:

.. code-block:: python

   def printing_decorator(func):
       def wrapper(*args, **kwds):
           print("Calling", func)
           return func(*args, **kwds)
       return wrapper

and we use it to decorate function ``add_forty_two``:

.. code-block:: python

   # A decorated function.
   @printing_decorator
   def add_forty_two(value: int) -> int:
       return value + 42

   a = add_forty_two(3)

Since ``printing_decorator`` is not type-annotated, the following won't get type checked:

.. code-block:: python

   reveal_type(a)        # Revealed type is "Any"
   add_forty_two('foo')  # No type checker error :(

This is a sorry state of affairs!

Here's how one could annotate the decorator:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Any, Callable, TypeVar, cast

   F = TypeVar('F', bound=Callable[..., Any])

   # A decorator that preserves the signature.
   def printing_decorator(func: F) -> F:
       def wrapper(*args, **kwds):
           print("Calling", func)
           return func(*args, **kwds)
       return cast(F, wrapper)

   @printing_decorator
   def add_forty_two(value: int) -> int:
       return value + 42

   a = add_forty_two(3)
   reveal_type(a)      # Revealed type is "builtins.int"
   add_forty_two('x')  # Argument 1 to "add_forty_two" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"

This still has some shortcomings. First, we need to use the unsafe
:py:func:`~typing.cast` to convince type checkers that ``wrapper()`` has the same
signature as ``func``.

Second, the ``wrapper()`` function is not tightly type checked, although
wrapper functions are typically small enough that this is not a big
problem. This is also the reason for the :py:func:`~typing.cast` call in the
``return`` statement in ``printing_decorator()``.

However, we can use a parameter specification (:py:class:`~typing.ParamSpec`),
for a more faithful type annotation:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Callable, TypeVar
   from typing_extensions import ParamSpec

   P = ParamSpec('P')
   T = TypeVar('T')

   def printing_decorator(func: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
       def wrapper(*args: P.args, **kwds: P.kwargs) -> T:
           print("Calling", func)
           return func(*args, **kwds)
       return wrapper

Parameter specifications also allow you to describe decorators that
alter the signature of the input function:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Callable, TypeVar
   from typing_extensions import ParamSpec

   P = ParamSpec('P')
   T = TypeVar('T')

   # We reuse 'P' in the return type, but replace 'T' with 'str'
   def stringify(func: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, str]:
       def wrapper(*args: P.args, **kwds: P.kwargs) -> str:
           return str(func(*args, **kwds))
       return wrapper

   @stringify
   def add_forty_two(value: int) -> int:
       return value + 42

   a = add_forty_two(3)
   reveal_type(a)      # Revealed type is "builtins.str"
   add_forty_two('x')  # error: Argument 1 to "add_forty_two" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"

Or insert an argument:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Callable, TypeVar
    from typing_extensions import Concatenate, ParamSpec

    P = ParamSpec('P')
    T = TypeVar('T')

    def printing_decorator(func: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[Concatenate[str, P], T]:
        def wrapper(msg: str, /, *args: P.args, **kwds: P.kwargs) -> T:
            print("Calling", func, "with", msg)
            return func(*args, **kwds)
        return wrapper

    @printing_decorator
    def add_forty_two(value: int) -> int:
        return value + 42

    a = add_forty_two('three', 3)

.. _decorator-factories:

Decorator factories
-------------------

Functions that take arguments and return a decorator (also called second-order decorators), are
similarly supported via generics:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Callable, TypeVar

    F = TypeVar('F', bound=Callable[..., Any])

    def route(url: str) -> Callable[[F], F]:
        ...

    @route(url='/')
    def index(request: Any) -> str:
        return 'Hello world'

Sometimes the same decorator supports both bare calls and calls with arguments. This can be
achieved by combining with :py:func:`@overload <typing.overload>`:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Callable, Optional, TypeVar, overload

    F = TypeVar('F', bound=Callable[..., Any])

    # Bare decorator usage
    @overload
    def atomic(__func: F) -> F: ...
    # Decorator with arguments
    @overload
    def atomic(*, savepoint: bool = True) -> Callable[[F], F]: ...

    # Implementation
    def atomic(__func: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None, *, savepoint: bool = True):
        def decorator(func: Callable[..., Any]):
            ...  # Code goes here
        if __func is not None:
            return decorator(__func)
        else:
            return decorator

    # Usage
    @atomic
    def func1() -> None: ...

Generic protocols
*****************

Protocols can also be generic (see also :ref:`protocol-types`). Several
:ref:`predefined protocols <predefined_protocols>` are generic, such as
:py:class:`Iterable[T] <typing.Iterable>`, and you can define additional generic
protocols. Generic protocols mostly follow the normal rules for generic classes.
Example:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypeVar
   from typing_extensions import Protocol

   T = TypeVar('T')

   class Box(Protocol[T]):
       content: T

   def do_stuff(one: Box[str], other: Box[bytes]) -> None:
       ...

   class StringWrapper:
       def __init__(self, content: str) -> None:
           self.content = content

   class BytesWrapper:
       def __init__(self, content: bytes) -> None:
           self.content = content

   do_stuff(StringWrapper('one'), BytesWrapper(b'other'))  # OK

   x: Box[float] = ...
   y: Box[int] = ...
   x = y  # Error -- Box is invariant

Note that ``class ClassName(Protocol[T])`` is allowed as a shorthand for
``class ClassName(Protocol, Generic[T])``, as per :pep:`PEP 544: Generic protocols <544#generic-protocols>`,

The main difference between generic protocols and ordinary generic classes is
that the declared variances of generic type variables in a protocol are checked
against how they are used in the protocol definition.  The protocol in this
example is rejected, since the type variable ``T`` is used covariantly as a
return type, but the type variable is invariant:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Protocol, TypeVar

   T = TypeVar('T')

   class ReadOnlyBox(Protocol[T]):  # error: Invariant type variable "T" used in protocol where covariant one is expected
       def content(self) -> T: ...

This example correctly uses a covariant type variable:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Protocol, TypeVar

   T_co = TypeVar('T_co', covariant=True)

   class ReadOnlyBox(Protocol[T_co]):  # OK
       def content(self) -> T_co: ...

   ax: ReadOnlyBox[float] = ...
   ay: ReadOnlyBox[int] = ...
   ax = ay  # OK -- ReadOnlyBox is covariant

See :ref:`variance-of-generics` for more about variance.

Generic protocols can also be recursive. Example:

.. code-block:: python

   T = TypeVar('T')

   class Linked(Protocol[T]):
       val: T
       def next(self) -> 'Linked[T]': ...

   class L:
       val: int
       def next(self) -> 'L': ...

   def last(seq: Linked[T]) -> T: ...

   result = last(L())
   reveal_type(result)  # Revealed type is "builtins.int"

.. _generic-type-aliases:

Generic type aliases
********************

Type aliases can be generic. In this case they can be used in two ways:
Subscripted aliases are equivalent to original types with substituted type
variables, so the number of type arguments must match the number of free type variables
in the generic type alias. Unsubscripted aliases are treated as original types with free
variables replaced with ``Any``. Examples (following :pep:`PEP 484: Type aliases
<484#type-aliases>`):

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import TypeVar, Iterable, Union, Callable

    S = TypeVar('S')

    TInt = tuple[int, S]
    UInt = Union[S, int]
    CBack = Callable[..., S]

    def response(query: str) -> UInt[str]:  # Same as Union[str, int]
        ...
    def activate(cb: CBack[S]) -> S:        # Same as Callable[..., S]
        ...
    table_entry: TInt  # Same as tuple[int, Any]

    T = TypeVar('T', int, float, complex)

    Vec = Iterable[tuple[T, T]]

    def inproduct(v: Vec[T]) -> T:
        return sum(x*y for x, y in v)

    def dilate(v: Vec[T], scale: T) -> Vec[T]:
        return ((x * scale, y * scale) for x, y in v)

    v1: Vec[int] = []      # Same as Iterable[tuple[int, int]]
    v2: Vec = []           # Same as Iterable[tuple[Any, Any]]
    v3: Vec[int, int] = [] # Error: Invalid alias, too many type arguments!

Type aliases can be imported from modules just like other names. An
alias can also target another alias, although building complex chains
of aliases is not recommended -- this impedes code readability, thus
defeating the purpose of using aliases.  Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Optional
    from example1 import AliasType
    from example2 import Vec

    # AliasType and Vec are type aliases (Vec as defined above)

    def fun() -> AliasType:
        ...

    T = TypeVar('T')

    class NewVec(Vec[T]):
        ...

    for i, j in NewVec[int]():
        ...

    OIntVec = Optional[Vec[int]]

Using type variable bounds or values in generic aliases has the same effect
as in generic classes/functions.


Generic class internals
***********************

You may wonder what happens at runtime when you index a generic class.
Indexing returns a *generic alias* to the original class that returns instances
of the original class on instantiation:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from typing import TypeVar, Generic
   >>> T = TypeVar('T')
   >>> class Stack(Generic[T]): ...
   >>> Stack
   __main__.Stack
   >>> Stack[int]
   __main__.Stack[int]
   >>> instance = Stack[int]()
   >>> instance.__class__
   __main__.Stack

Generic aliases can be instantiated or subclassed, similar to real
classes, but the above examples illustrate that type variables are
erased at runtime. Generic ``Stack`` instances are just ordinary
Python objects, and they have no extra runtime overhead or magic due
to being generic, other than overloading the indexing operation.

Note that in Python 3.8 and lower, the built-in types
:py:class:`list`, :py:class:`dict` and others do not support indexing.
This is why we have the aliases :py:class:`~typing.List`,
:py:class:`~typing.Dict` and so on in the :py:mod:`typing`
module. Indexing these aliases gives you a generic alias that
resembles generic aliases constructed by directly indexing the target
class in more recent versions of Python:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> # Only relevant for Python 3.8 and below
   >>> # For Python 3.9 onwards, prefer `list[int]` syntax
   >>> from typing import List
   >>> List[int]
   typing.List[int]

Note that the generic aliases in ``typing`` don't support constructing
instances:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from typing import List
   >>> List[int]()
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   TypeError: Type List cannot be instantiated; use list() instead
